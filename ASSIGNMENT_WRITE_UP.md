Summarizing the Data and Drawing Conclusions:

The analysis in this notebook is an examination of both Students and Schools  in both Charter and District categories. This examiniation 
included facets of the school such as Student totals, Budgets, Per Student Budgets average scores, etc.. The Students were analyzed on the bases 
of passing classes based upon grades in math and reading, as well as how many students would pass both. The analysis also examined passing 
percentages by grade as well as school. The data and analysis is also solid foundation for potentially identifying some differences in 
performance for students in charter or district schools. 


This data may have limitations that it does not include other subjects, class sizes (only budget per student), resources available to students, 
and other factors that could influence students' performance (such as parent involvement). 

Two Conclusions that we can draw from this data set are that based on this data, Charter schools have a significantly higher overall passing 
percentage than district schools. This could be an area of further study, as it could be due to resources allocated differently (teachers as 
opposed to larger facilities), different staffing, etc.. While the per budget students in the Charter schools are not noticeably different than 
the distric schools, it is possible that something like class size could be a larger indicator of performance (district schools have larger 
budget but the same per capita budget, meaning there are inherently more students in the school which the numbers support). Another factor that 
could cause this is charter schools could posses student bodies that have more involved parents. It could also be due to charter schools ability 
to develop their own curriculums. This means that students might pass at higher rates due to easier curriculums (designed to make the school 
look more effective than it may be) or that the standards may be different than the more rigid district schools. 


A second conclusion 
is that passing math is more difficult than reading in district schools. While the top perforrming schools saw a relatively similar percentage 
of students pass both math and reading, the lower performing schools saw noticeably more students struggle with math relative to reading. This 
trend remained consistent both across lower performing schools but also across students within the same school. This would suggest that math is 
a more difficult subject to communicate effectively, as overall reading was rather consistent regardless of school and did not see the variation 
that math saw.
